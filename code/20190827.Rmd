# Statistical Methods

## Descriptive Statistics

Collect and describe data (sample).

## Inferential Statistics

Collect, analyze, interpret, and make inferences/conclusions about data. Goal is to make inferences about larger population.

# Terms

- Observation unit
- Population: complete set of observation units
- Sample: subset
- Census: when sample equals population

# EXTRA

Denver Post: 2010 census missed more than 1.5 mil minorities (AA 2.1%, Latinos 1.5%, renters, young men, homeless) but double-counted those with two homes. 

# Terms continued

- Variable
- Statistic: numerical descriptive measure for sample (y bar)
- Parameter: " for population (mu); true but unknown

# EXTRA

Denver Post: Netherlands (men - 6 ft) & Latvia (women - 5' 6") lead world for people's height. 

# Return to Statistical Methods

95% confidence interval to capture true population mean.

## First Principle of Statistical Inference

Make inference to population from which you sample. 

1. 50 observations of 1 cow (unreplicated or pseudoreplication) -- must replicate by having more cows. 

2. Limited sample to one strain or batch. 

3. NIH-funded study of BABL/c mice to improve breast cancer treatment. 
- "IT SAYS ONLY IN MICE." 
  - model organism / animal studies: try to extrapolate findings from mice to humans BUT be careful
  
# Target vs. Sampled Populations

In modeled organisms, samples are usually far from target population. 

e.g., river diagram (Cornfield and Tukey) - bridge from sample to target population (stat inferences, scientific judgement)

# Planning Research Study

1, Specific aims and research questions
2. Variables of interest (response, predictor)
3. Study design
4. Execute study
