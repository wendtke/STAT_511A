When you create a new R Markdown something like the following will appear automatically, but we will not use the Knit button to author documents for now. cars is a "built-in" dataset.  Note in the gray box there is a green play button.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# You can write code in chunks that look like this.
# This chunk uses the code summary (cars) to get a five-number (plus mean).
# To run the code click the Green play button to the right. Try it!
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r cars}
plot(cars)
```
