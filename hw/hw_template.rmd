# Problem 1 

## part 1(a)
We simulate data from a simple linear regression model and make a plot.
```{r simulatedata}
set.seed(2019)
x = runif(20, 10, 20)
y = rnorm(20, mean = 3 + 5*x,  sd = 4)
plot(x, y)
```

## part 1 (b)

\answerstart

Looking at the plot of x vs y, there appears to be a strong, positive linear relationship.

# Problem 2

We will fit a simple linear regression model to the data. The model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i + \epsilon_i$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n$. There are assumptions on the errors $\epsilon_i$ as follows:

  1. the errors have mean 0, $E(\epsilon_i) = 0$
  2. the errors have the same variance (homoskedastic), $V(\epsilon_i) = \sigma^2$
  3. the errors are independent
  4. the errors follow a normal distribution
  
We summarize the assumptions as $\epsilon_i \sim^{i.i.d} N(0, \sigma^2)$.

# Problem 3
We estimate the simple linear regression model and display the summary.
```{r fitmodel}
#fit the model
model1 = lm(y ~ x)
#look a summary - this prints the estimated coefficients
summary(model1)
```

# Problem 4

## part 4(a)

\answerstart

The \textbf{estimated} slope is $\widehat{\beta}_1 = 5.26$ and the \textbf{estimated} intercept is $\widehat{\beta}_0 = -0.95$. We can also see $\widehat{\sigma} = 5.17$.

## part 4(b)

\answerstart

Interpretation of the slope: for each 1 unit increase in $x$, the average value of $y$ *increases* by an estimated 5.26.

\answerend

## part 4(c)

```{r anova}
anova(model1)
```
\answerstart

The SSE for this model is 480.4.

\answerend

## part 4(d)
```{r SStot}
SSreg <- anova(model1)[1,2]
SSreg
SSres <- anova(model1)[2,2]
SSres
SStot <- SSreg + SSres
round(SStot, 1)
```

\answerstart

The sum of squares total for this model is 4900.4.
